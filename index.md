# Therapy for People Who Think Deeply, Feel Fully, and Have Always Been A Little Different
*For highly sensitive, gifted, intuitive, analytical, and thoughtful adults navigating complexity, identity shifts, and profound inner change.*

---

## Many of the people I work with have always lived with a rich, intense inner world.

Some feel everything deeply: attuned to nuance, emotional currents, relational shifts, the unsaid things other people miss. 

Others grew up in their minds---reading early, thinking quickly, analyzing instinctively---often because it was the safest place to live.

And many hold both truths at once:  
**a mind that moves fast and a heart that feels deeply.**

Along the way, you may have learned to shrink or mute parts of yourself---your curiosity, sensitivity, or intensity---because it made life easier for others.  
But it never quite fit.

You may have heard you’re “too sensitive,” or you may have been praised for being “so mature,” “so smart,” or “so responsible,” while quietly learning to hide the parts of you that felt too much or too different.

If this feels familiar, you're not alone.

## When the life you built no longer feels like yours

People often come to me in moments when life stops making sense---when the story they’ve lived no longer matches the story unfolding.

Sometimes the shift is sudden:

* a breakup or divorce you didn’t see coming  
* career burnout that hits hard
* a diagnosis that rearranges everything   
* a loss that reshapes your world—--of a person, a relationship, or a version of life you counted on  
* a moment when you realize you can't keep going the way you have  

Other times, the change is quieter:

- *I don’t know who I am anymore.*  
- *Everything I built is falling apart, or no longer fits.*  
- *I'm questioning beliefs I never thought I'd question.*  
- *I've spent my life being what others needed. Now I don’t know what I want.*  
- *It feels like falling down a rabbit hole. I don't know which way is up.*  
- *I feel like I'm unraveling and rebuilding at the same time.*  

Some describe it as hiking in earthquake country; the ground itself is shifting under your feet.

You don’t have to navigate it alone.

## A space for people who never fit the template

The people I work with often describe themselves as:

- gifted or high-ability adults  
- highly sensitive, perceptive, intuitive humans  
- former “gifted kids” who learned to make themselves smaller  
- analytical thinkers told they’re “too in their head”  
- people who often feel like outsiders, even among their own  
- individuals living in the in-between: no longer who they were, not yet who they’re becoming  

You might recognize yourself in phrases like:

- *“I've always felt different, not in a bad way, just . . . different.”*  
- *“I don’t feel connected to peers the way other people seem to.”*  
- *“Small talk exhausts me. I want depth.”*  
- *“I’m good at many things, so choosing one feels impossible.”*  
- *“People think I’m put-together, but inside I feel lost.”*  
- *“My worth has always been tied to achievement.”*  
- *“I'm comfortable in my mind, but the rest of me feels harder to access.”*  
- *“I've never really known how to just be myself without editing.”*  

You don’t have to simplify yourself here.  
Your depth is welcome.

## How I work

My approach blends clarity, depth, and emotional attunement. I draw from:

- [**The NeuroAffective Relational Model (NARM)**](https://narmtraining.com/what-is-narm/) — for identity, agency, connection, attachment, and longstanding patterns  

- [**Accelerated Resolution Therapy (ART)**](https://acceleratedresolutiontherapy.com/what-is-art/) — for emotional blocks, trauma, and stuck images  

- **Ketamine-Assisted Psychotherapy (KAP)** — for depression, existential distress, depth, and meaning-making

- A **neurodivergence-affirming lens**, honoring sensitivity, intensity, and complexity  

- My background in **English and computer science**, integrating story and system, metaphor and logic  

Clients often describe therapy with me as steady, grounding, and spacious,  
a place where nothing has to be forced, rushed, or minimized.
