# Speaking & Media
<img src="{{ '/assets/images/speaking.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="Sara speaking at Mormon Mental Health Association conference" class="speaking-img">

My talks explore how to live a meaningful, grounded, connected life, especially after religion. I’m interested in what “best practices” look like for people who no longer have a built-in roadmap.

This page gathers some of the places I’ve spoken and the conversations I’ve been part of.
